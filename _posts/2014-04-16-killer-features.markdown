title: "Killer Features"
---

Some products have 'killer' features. These features are so frustrating that they kill my desire to use said products. Some examples:

- A mobile app or Facebook Connect website asks for absurd permissions. "To use this post-it app, please give us access to your SMS history, your phone calls, your address book, your wallet, and your fingerprint." Result: I uninstall the app or leave the website, then go look for alternatives.
- A sign-up form enforces a draconian password policy. "Your password must be 12+ characters, and must include at least three digits, two Wingdings, and one ancient Aramaic proverb." Result: I comply when I set the password, get frustrated at having to use "Forgot Password" each time I return to the site, then go look for alternatives.
- I get an email without an unsubscribe link, or with an unsubscribe link that requires logging in and navigating privacy settings. Result: I try to log in to update my email preferences. If I forgot my password, I mark the email spam so that I don't see emails like it in the future. I also mentally blacklist the website as "annoying and spammy."
- When joining a GoToMeeting conference call, I have about 6 seconds to enter a 9-digit PIN. If I've only managed to enter 7 digits before time runs out, GTM abruptly hangs up on me. Result: whenever someone invites me to use GoToMeeting, I ask them if we can use something else.
- YouTube keeps asking to use my real name, which I don't want to do. Result: I've started uploading videos to Vimeo instead.  

The lesson here is that poorly placed friction points can ruin an otherwise great product. Look at GoToMeeting: if you think about it, it's an_ amazing_ technology. Three people who are thousands of miles apart can join a virtual meeting, share their screens with each other, share comments and links via text chat, and talk on the phone -- all at the same time! For free. How great is that? And yet, because the experience of joining a meeting is frustrating, I cringe every time I see a GTM invite.

I know, I know, #firstworldproblems, right? Right. If you're providing a service with lock-in, like an enterprise product that's forced on all employees by management, then friction is fine. People will resent it, but they'll put up with it because they won't have a choice. However, if you're in a market where users have many alternatives to choose from, your funnel is going to suffer. You'll have fewer sign-ups, lower engagement, and higher churn. A smooth user experience is very important. Startups should track user behavior, find clear points of friction and frustration, and eliminate them. Do you really need to _force_ users to use unhackable passwords? Would the world end if you gave someone an extra 5 seconds to enter a meeting PIN, or if you let them post videos under an alias? No, probably not. Don't let decisions like that impede the adoption of your otherwise great product.
