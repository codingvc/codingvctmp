When it comes to starting a company, two key components are having an idea for a product and having the ability to build that product. If you have an idea but can't built it yourself because you're not an engineer, you can either try to figure short term hacks that can postpone your need for engineers (e.g. create a <a href="http://www.allencheng.com/concierge-mvp/" target="_blank">Concierge MVP</a>) or follow Naval Ravikant's advice: find a great engineer and help them with everything outside of programming.

If you have the ability to create products but *don't* have an idea, then this blog post is for you. I've had the opportunity to talk to over one thousand founders about how they came up with their product ideas. This post describes some of the idea generation pattenrs that I have noticed.

This post contains a catalog of some of the most common Startup Idea Patterns. The catalog format is inspired by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8" target="_blank">Design Patterns</a>, a software engineering book that had a deep influence on me when I was a novice software engineer. <u>Design Patterns</u> described common software challenges and proven solutions to those challenges. It also offered tips, warnings, and examples for each solution pattern. Similarly, each Startup Idea Pattern includes a description, examples, and a small collection of tips and warnings. Hopefully reading about various formulas for product ideas will help engineers and builders come up with their own viable company ideas.

## Table of Contents
TOC with links...
 
## Recently Enabled Idea
**Description:** a new advancement enables an idea that was not possible before. The advancement could be a new technology (e.g. blockchain or deep learning), a new distribution channel (e.g. mobile phones or VR glasses or Salesforce's AppExchange), regulatory changes, 

## OMGWTF, REALLY?
**Description:** You catch yourself doing something that feels absurd in today's world. That could be faxing or printing something, or having to download a desktop application to perform some simple task, or having to stand in line for hours, or maybe . e.g. need paper version of something for proof, wait in line for 3 hours to do something that takes a minute, etc. Something feels like an anachronism.

= UNLOCKED ENABLER
Something wasn't possible before because a key tech was missing. Now that tech is finally available or mainstream.
Example
Enabler can be many things:
- delivery mechanism (widespread proliferation of phones => uber)
- technology (distributed computing => all of the startups focused on big data)
- regulatory changes, current events and rising trends (e.g. recent attention to abuse of police power might enable startups that help monitor police behavior)

Tips/Warnings
- Make sure enabler isn't about to be superceded by something better. For example, maybe a recent solar cell innovation enables you to build a more compact robot, but that could be made obsolete by the innovate of more compact batteries.

= OLD PRODUCT, NEW PLATFORM
 rebuild an important product w/limitations on top of a new/recently popular computing interface (mobile, chat, voice, AR/VR, etc)
   caveat: can't just be X but via chat... has to have "true" advantages.
   examples:


=OLD PRODUCT, NEW TECH
 rebuild an improtant product w/limitations on onew tech (mobile, blockchain, voice, chat interface, AR/VR, etc)


= THIRD TIME IS A CHARM
DESC: You've built the same product multiple times across several different companies. This might be an internal HR tool or analytics platform or some piece of software infrastructure. Each time you build the same thing, you learn lessons and your next iteration gets better. You realize the absurdity of a
EXAMPLES: LITTLE BIRD?
WARNINGS/GOTCHAS:
nice because you have good idea of how to build something the right way AND experience that validates some market need.
make sure market need is broad enough though. what if you were picked for last few jobs because you were one of few people that had this expeirence because the experience is rare and not often needed/developed?

= DEMOCRATIZING EXCLUSIVE TOOLS
Everyone needs a tool but only huge companies have resources to build it.
Market leaders like Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix often have exclusive tools and infrastructure that is not available to their competitors. Sometime
Example: Interana, Scalyr??

= MAKING ADVANCED TOOLS MORE ACCESSIBLE
Professionals have specialized tools: data scientists have scipy, pro photographers have photoshop, etc.
also, democratize fraction of big company tool (built 100%, now building the right 90% for everyone)
   do others really need tool? do economics work? are people not building because does

= SPECIALIZED TOOL
crm is great for sales, but for a certain kind of sales you need something special (veeva)
google analytics is great, but for certain types of sites you need more

basically go really deep in a domain
but -- is that domain big enough?

= KEY DATA PROVIDER
(nextcaller datafox/mattermark talentiq intricately) (like democratizing eclusive tools... big companies can sometimes do this themselves, but it doesnt make sense for everyone to rebuild something very time intensive)
criteria = data is valuable BUT hard to garther on your own. (give an example of waht's easy/hard?)

=CROSS DOMAIN TOOL TRANSFER
a/b testing for.. retail, commerce, agriculture.
mint.com/easier budgeting and accounting for... general counsel (simple legal), doctors, 
CRM for sales... then dentists, etc

= CONVERT SERVICE TO SELF-SERVE
   e.g. web design tools
   workflow building tools (consultant -> drag and drop)

= CENTRALIZED VIEW
scalyr (lots of tools at google -> 1 tool)
datafox/mattermark (open lots of tabs manually -> 1 tool)

= MODERNIZE OLD PROCESSES
fax, paper, phone -> digital 
trojan horse for data!
flexport etc
rockbot: bakground music + jukeboxes -> digital/mobile/cloud



= LEADGEN FOR OFFLINE BIZ
Insurance tech, mint.com, policy genius, etc

= BUSINESS MODEL TRANSFER
  try before you buy works for furniture, why not gadgets? lumoid
  name your price works for travle, why not electronics? greentoe
  monetizing on the backend instead of cahrging customers works for zenefits... why not corporate travel? nextravel

= PARTIAL AUTOMATION
- focus on easier half of a job. outlier, simplelegal, clara labs/x.ai -- don't replace analysts or admins but make them productive. 



WHERE ELSE CAN I PLUG MORE PORT COS?
THINK BOUT ORIGIN OF EACH PORT CO
THINK ABOUT OTHER COMPANIES I LIKE AND HOW THEY STARTED
THINK ABOUT UNICORN LIST
WHERE DID I GET MY IDEAS?
ASK PEOPLE TO SUGGEST OTHER PATTERNS
