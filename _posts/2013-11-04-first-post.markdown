I'm a software engineer who recently moved into the world of venture capital. As one of the four partners at <a href="http://www.susaventures.com/" target="_blank">Susa Ventures</a>, I spend my days meeting and talking with founders, doing technical and non-technical due diligence to decide if specific startups are a good match for Susa, and offering technical advice to companies that we invest in. It's a great job that gives me the chance to meet a lot of smart, passionate entrepreneurs.

This blog will cover topics relevant to angel investors (e.g. tips for doing technical due diligence), entrepreneurs (e.g. tips for more effective pitches), and anyone who is interested in how startup investing works (e.g. how seed funds work, what kind of questions get asked during due diligence, general observations about investing, et cetera).
