Soliciting Investor Feedback
A lot of founders struggle with questions about investor feedback. Should founders reach out to investors for feedback if they aren't currently fundraising? How often? How should conflicting feedback be processed? Etc. This post will address some of the most common questions.

Should you ask investors for feedback?
**Yes**. The average investor won't understand your specific business as deeply as you do, but they've looked at hundreds of companies with similar characteristics. Maybe you're building a marketplace for on-demand dental care. Would an investor know how much about that specific business? Unlikely. But there's a good chance they've looked at many marketplaces, and maybe a few dental care companies (or at least a few healthcare companies). They can share their experiences about where marketplaces (of all types) struggle, as well as what kinds of go-to-market approaches and strategies tend to be effective. 

What questions should you ask?
Here are some potential questions to ask:
* What aspects of a company excite you?
* What do you think will be our biggest challenges in the next 6-12 months?
* Does this company fall in your investment focus area?
* What would you want to see before deciding whether 

What questions you be careful with?

What if I don't like an investors answers?

How many investors should I talk to?

How often should you ask?
If you're not fundraising, you should aim for talking to any specific investor once, *maybe* twice, before you go out to raise money. The first time you talk to an investor, you'll each learn a lot about each other. You'll learn about what the investor is looking for when evaluating companies, their focus areas, and what they would like to see your company accomplish to 
  
  Questions to ask: biggest risks/opportunities/oversights. what would you like to see us do over the next round (hesitation might mean they don't care). 
  Types of feedback
investors == also a good filter.
talk about day in the life. ask them about their problems? what do you they want to be able to do/struggle to do
e.g. for move loot "what are you looking to buy? how would you buy it? here's a way to buy. would use it?"

title: "Conflicting Feedback is Still Good Feedback"

A couple of founders recently asked me about how to handle conflicting feedback. One founder had been talking to investors about what kind of traction was required to raise a Series A, and every investor they spoke to suggested a different set of milestones. In parallel, another founder was interviewing prospective customers, and each prospect requested a different set of product features. Because the feedback seemed to conflict, the two founders didn't know which milestones to pursue and which features to build.

## Processing Inconsistent Investor Feedback
Just because feedback from investors is inconsistent doesn't mean it's conflicting or wrong -- especially when it comes to company milestones. One investor may say they only invest in companies with at least $2m in annual revenue while another may prefer that you build a community with at least 250k active users. Which investor is right? *Both of them*.

Each investor has a unique utility function and set of preferences, and trying to find the average set of preferences is the wrong approach. Instead, you should think about what kind of vision and company-building strategy you believe in. Do you think the best way to achieve your goals is to grow your user base and monetize later? If so, work on that and target Investor #2. If, instead, you believe that accumulating revenue as early as possible is more important, then work on that and target Investor #1. Taking the middle path and reaching 100k active users and $300k in annual revenue is a weak outcome because neither investor ends up being happy with your progress.

This is very similar to dating. If you went on one hundred dates with one hundred people, you wouldn't try to become the average of what those people were looking for. Instead, you'd continue going out with the person you were most compatible with.

## Processing Inconsistent Customer Feedback
Customer feedback can be trickier to process, especially when a company's customer base is tiny or non-existent. While most startups only need a small handful of investors, all startups need a lot customers to become very successful. As a result, companies can't optimize their product for a single customer. Instead, they should weigh each customer's preferences by how many similar customers there might be. Fortunately, customers are usually well-intentioned when discussing their preferences -- they won't tell you that they'd prefer feature X to feature Y if they actually prefer Y to X. 

If everyone you talk to wants the same features, then that's terrific. If feedback and feature requests vary greatly, that can imply one of several scenarios:

- **You need to get more data by talking to more people.**
- **You're asking the wrong questions.** For example, maybe your questions are too open-ended and you need to narrow them down. The answers to "what would your ideal mode of transportation look like?" will be much more varied than the answers to "what features would you want in a $50k luxury car?"
- **You need to narrow down the types of people you approach.** For example instead of talking to salespeople, maybe you should only be talking to software salespeople, or VPs of sales at SaaS companies. The more diverse the group of people you talk to, the less consistent their preferences will be.
- **Your customers don't know their true preferences.** This can happen if you're asking people about products that they've never used and can't fully imagine. You may have to show them prototypes or even finished products instead of asking them what they need.
- **The market's demands are very heterogeneous.** Some products naturally involve a lot of consulting and customization work.

It's important to figure out which scenario you're experiencing. For example, if the market's demands are heterogeneous, then talking to more prospects is not a good use of time -- that will only reinforce that each customer has different needs.

## Takeaways

If you're heart diverse, conflicting feedback about something, don't assume
A few general heuristics when considering diverse feedback:

- More data is better -- but at some point you have to stop searching for more data and start making decisions.
- When your data doesn't support a simple conclusion, that might be a conclusion in and of itself.
- Getting conflicting feedback can mean you need more data, or it can reflect a lack of consensus about what constitutes the best solution, or it can imply that "best" is a varying notion for the question you're asking.
