title: Ways I Can Help
---
(This page is intended for current/prospective portfolio companies.) 

I often tell people, "let me know if I can help with anything," but what does that really mean? In general, I think <a href="{{site.url}}extracting-more-value-from-investors" target="_blank">founders should ask investors for anything they can think of</a>. That said, here's my attempt at an exhaustive list of things I'm good at and things I'm not so good at.

**Overall philosophy...**

- I help whenever possible and try to get out of the way when I can't. My goal is to be a resource, not an anchor.
- I try to reach out proactively every month or so, but please feel free to email me/get in touch with me whenever you'd like.
- I'm honest about what I do and do not know. If I don't know the answer to your question, I will tell you that instead of just making stuff up.

**I can provide feedback on...**

- your product (UX/UI, new features, website copy, new mobile app builds, etc).
- product direction and features ideas.
- pitch decks.
- sales decks.
- general company strategy.
- any type of written work: blog posts, one-pagers, etc.
- etc.

**I can provide high-level software design assistance with...**

- API design and API feedback.
- Written product specs, API specs, and API docs.
- System design and system design feedback.
- Working through use cases for pushing a product into production.
- Advice on infrastructure design decisions (which NoSQL datastore to use, etc). I'm not super experienced here, but sometimes I know enough to be useful.

**I have practical software domain expertise in...**

- strategy and implementation details around data cleaning, deduping/entity resolution, data enrichment, etc.
- designing data processing pipelines (advice about high-level design rather than specific infrastructure decisions).
- fraud detection (and related problems).
- feature design for ML problems. I did a lot of this while working on fraud detection at Google and on deduping at Factual.
- I don't know ML, but I'm good at algorithms/heuristics/etc. I love thinking about hard/intractable problems and am pretty good at solving them (I used to place well in national and international programming competitions).

**Ways I can help with recruiting...**

- forwarding potential candidates whom I meet if they seem like a good fit (if you tell me what you're looking for).
- screening/interview process design (I did this a lot at my last job).
- recruiting strategies and messaging (I did this a lot at my last job).
- helping close candidates after they receive offers.
- interviewing your first engineer or two.

**Intros I can provide..**

- the longer I work as a VC, the stronger my network gets -- especially if you want to talk to other CTOs/CEOs/engineers and learn from their experiences.

**Miscellanea**

- I have a fairly broad view of stuff happening in the tech world and I can provide market research about companies addressing specific problems.
- I work with ~40 startups and can dig up benchmarks on everything from typical accounting costs to average rent/employee/month in SF.
- I spent 2000-2012 as a professional software engineer at Microsoft, LinkedIn, Google, and Factual, plus I still write code on the side, so my advice tends to be rooted in practice rather than theory.
- I like helping and I'm open to just about anything. If there's something not on this list, please ask. If I don't know how to help, I promise I'll be honest about that and won't try to fake it in order to sound smart =).
