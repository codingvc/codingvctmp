# metrics should be robust
  e.g. workramp active users was very prone to seasonality
  e.g. mashgin returning customers dipped when there was a new location.
KPI should indicate performance w/o false positives or negatives
good litmus test: draw graph: if dips and peaks reflect interesting good or bad events, then that's great. But if you find yourself saying things like "ignore this peak, we had a new customer sign up that day" or "ignore that dip, it's when a lot of holiday temp workers ended their employment"then that's a yellow flag.
