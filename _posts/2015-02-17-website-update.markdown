I just switched my blog over from <a href="http://posthaven.com">Posthaven</a> to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. If you run into any issues on the site, please <a href="mailto:leo@susaventures.com">let me know</a>!

If you're an email subscriber, you might receive a one-time email as a result of me migrating the subscriber list to MailChimp.
 
I plan to resume writing this week. The next post will likely be a catalog of business models that leverage data.
