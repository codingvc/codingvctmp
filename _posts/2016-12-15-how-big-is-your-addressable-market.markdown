At some point during every B2B startup pitch, the investor will ask, "What's your TAM?" (TAM = Total Addressable Market). Over the the last few years, I've seen many approaches to quantifying market sizes. This post is meant to be a comprehensive guide to what TAM is, why it matters, and how to estimate it.

## What is TAM?<a name="what-is-tam"></a>
TAM is a measure of your potential market size. There are three related definitions:

<dl>
  <dt>TAM</dt>
  <dd>Total Addressable Market.</dd>
  <dt>SAM</dt>
  <dd>Serviceable Available Market.</dd>
  <dt>SOM</dt>
  <dd>Serviceable Obtainable Market.</dd>
</dl>

Most of the time people just talk about TAM and it's understood that the reference is to the total revenue a company would have if it could reach 100% market penetration in its target market.

## Why is TAM important?<a name="why-is-tam-important"></a>

Investors care about TAM for several reasons:

* It's a good way for a founder to demonstrate their critical thinking skills and market insight. If someone's estimate of market is "there are seven billion people in the world, and I think 10% would buy my product for $10, so the TAM is $7B," then that's a red flag. That's a very lame, lazy way to calculate market size.

* TAM calculations can help prioritize product direction. Let's say the TAM for a company is $10b. The company's direction might be very different depending on whether the TAM is based on a $9.5b opportunity among SMBs and a $500m opportunity among large companies, or $500m from SMBs and $9.5B from large companies.

* TAM is a proxy for how valuable a company could be if it were wildly successful. If a company is going after a $100m market, it's unlikely to every go public. If it's going after a $100b market, then it might become one of the most valuable companies in the world.

## TAM Estimation Techniques<a name="tam-estimation"></a>
Here are some of the most common techniques for estimating TAM:

* Citing research reports. "A recent Gartner report says that enterprise accounting software is a $12b market." These figures are often reduced based on market dynamics.

There are two main ways to estimate market-size: **top-down** and **bottom-up**.

**Top-down** estimation starts with a high level figure like total global spending on a market, then whittles down that figure based on your assumptions of which customers are not well served. For example: "We're building a CRM product for logistics companies. Global CRM spend is $10b, and logistics companies are 5% of global companies, so our TAM is $500M"

**Bottom-up** 

## Estimation Tips and Tricks<a name="estimation-tips"></a>
## Estimation Gotchas<a name="estimation-gotchas"></a>

An algorithm for estimating your total addressable market:

Step 1: Segment your customers based on size or need. If you have pricing tiers, what kind of companies would be in each tier?

## Useful resources<a name="useful-resources"></a>

tam by analogy in other markets
tam from competitor figures
tam from analyst numbers
tam from per job role estimates
tam from customer company estimates. e.g. we sell to these kinds of companies, 
tam from industry budgets.
tam from segmenting customers and estimating spend

tips
- based on your business model

warnings
- leave out outliers
- leave out unserviceable (too small, regulated/special needs, etc)
- adjust for your business model/pricing. e.g. if you want to undercut by 50%.













TIPS
- suggestion (plausible) expansions. plausibe: doctors -> dentists. implausibe: doctors -> venture capitalists.
- emphasize growth rates for smaller markets
dont worry about growth is market is huge.
- address shrinkage for shrinking markets. (e.g. feature phones.)worry about shrinkage if it's declining (slrs, etc)

Methods
tam by analogy?
tam from competitors?
estimate supply from competitors
estimate demand from potential customers

if you sell to specific user (e.g. CIO of companhy with 500+ cmployees), linkedi nadvanced search can help

Tips/Notes
what if you cut costs?
will you expand the market?
dont look at very general markets. 

top mistakes from last 100-250 decks
Warnings
dont forget outliers... e.g. ecomm is 300b, but amazon is 25%, and they often build their own stuff. similarly, maybe you want to sell infras monitoring to companies... fb/goog/twitter probably roll their own
TRIANGULATE!! wisdom of crowds
dont pick numbers out of your ss.. the smaller the number the bigger the idfference. E.g. 63% interested... what if it's 64 or 62%? no big deal. okay, 1% interested.. what if it's 2% or 0%? huge difference!

DATA > ASSUMPTIONS  
  but watch out for  biases (e.g. if you're selling to senior citizens, then maybe running test adwords campaign won't be a true measure of interest)
WILL VARY BASED ON BIZ MODEL!
  1000 companies spending $1m-$5m each on XYZ (total XYZ spend is $2.5b). if you charge 4% of adspend, your TAM is $100m. If you charge $4k/mo/company, your TAM is $48m

TAM = Your Total Available or Addressable Market (everyone you wish to reach with your product)
SAM = Your Segmented Addressable Market or Served Available Market (the portion of TAM you will target)
SOM = Your Share of the Market (the subset of your SAM that you will realistically reach â€“ particularly in the first few years of your business)

ipad: In this case, the TAM comprised all types of portable music players such as Discman, Walkman, and digital players. The SAM comprised digital MP3 players, which accounted for a very small percentage of the overall category in early last decade when iPod was introduced. The SOM for iPod ended up greater than 70% over the years, and has remained there.

	TAM/SAM/SOM formalities... i dont care what the size of real estate is, how the vanity metric for market size including the 10 huge companies that will never buy your product.. what's your *true* addressable market?
	
	TAM is you market size at 100% penetration
	
	bottom up vs top down
	
	ways to frame market: # of times problem comes up, # of people with a problem, # total global spending on a problem, combined revenue of competitors addressing this market (have to decide if they represent full market (e.g. toilet paper probalby has complete market peentration) or part of market (amazon is big but still growing)
	
	going to adjacent markets must be plausible
	
	try to get good data. gartner is meh... who do you know how thye got their numbers? (** verify.. does gartner explain how they got their numbers?)
	
	Example (okay to make up numbers): food delivery in US is $Xb. but you're only delivering sushi... sushi is y% of restaurants, so your market is x*y. furthermore, you want to focus on US cities with >1m people, and those cities represent Z% of food delivery... so market is x*y*z
	
	
	make sure you dont imply you're going after an entire market by yourself. e.g. CRM is $50b/year. okay, but salesforce, veeva, free stuff.. are you really going to get $50b? or "on demand services are $50b"... well that includes uber, prescriptions, doctor visits,... are you going to do all of those things? no? then your tam is not 50b.


based on your biz model. e.g. if you charge $100/yar

why do big tams matter?
1) need that to go public
2) conventional wisdom is that it's not that much harder to build $5b company than to build $500m company. Both are super harder, but the former is not 10x harder than the latter. Since the difficulty is comparable, why not be more ambitious? (and from the investors' perpsective, if you ahd another company have a 1% shot of hitting your goals, then they'd rather invest in 1% of a bigger market size)



Common errors:
[glassbreakers https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#search/to%3Ame+deck+has%3Aattachment/158cdf515ab7ecf4?projector=1]
-- a bunch of unrelated facts, then a number that comes out of nowhere. (>5 million people need X. people are willing to spend 1k-10k on X. therefore our TAM is $12.3B (huh, how does that follow?)

[nml https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#search/to%3Ame+deck+has%3Aattachment/158900ca242f59de]
-- unsubstantiated TAM. "our tam is "$12b." okay, why?

[cstore pro/shopfront/etc]
-- ignoring the shape of your market.  if you're in an industry where the biggest players wont buy from you, your TAM should reflect that. E.g. if you sell something to ecomm website and plan to charge 1% of revenue, you can't really claim that your market is 1% of $200b b/c amazon is 40% of that (http://wwd.com/business-news/financial/amazon-walmart-top-ecommerce-retailers-10383750/) and either has built or will build whatever you're making. so realistically your market is 1% of 120b, not 200b (and perhaps less if there are other large merchants you can't reach]

weird breakdowns:
our tam for XYZ is: $2.5b at restaurants, 130m at bars, $30m at bowling alleys -- just list restaurants.. it's fine

med2go https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#search/to%3Ame+deck+has%3Aattachment++-sevanta/15842d4cda4eaba7?projector=1
irrelevant numbers (global/us commerce -> online eletronics retailers...)

valuation by proxy when proxies are irreelvant
marketing sys of record -- marketo: 5b
sales sys of record -- salesforce: 50b
hair stylist system of record -- $BBBillions [lol]

piecemeal
10 different markets -- 100m each... that sucks =( lots of makreting work, understanding custeomrs, etc, and often cant focus on all 10 markets to opportunity for otehrs to take some of the marketshare

superset of market
"enterprise spend on CRM is $9b" but you make CRMs for companies with ACVs of 250k+, so that's not the whole market... what's *YOUR* tam?

if you're offering lower prices, that hurts your tam. "companies spend $4B on XYZ. We will offer a better version of XYZ for one tenth of the price!" (okay, so your tam is 400m)

waste != spend
e.g. "X industry pays $Y in fines/fees/wasted energy every year" okay, but your tam is not $Y. If I waste $100 on electricity a year, you can't offer to sell me a product to save electricity for $100/year.. i have no incentive to buy. Typically a business might capture 10-25% of a customer's savings, so your TAM should be discounted accordingly

ignoring distribution of customers. if it's powerlaw/fat head-long tail, then you need to take that into account. e.g. "we make a service for movies... $100k/movie, 25k movies made per year" .... but 24000 of those movies probably dont have a budget where they can pay you $100k...

profit is more important than topline. For example, if credit card companies charge 2.9%, and you want to provide services and take 3% for procesing, your tam is not 3% of $1t in spending, is 0.1% of $1t in spending

VERY HARD FOR NEW MARKETS
 - by analogy (lumoid)
  - estimate in several aways
  - users * conservative price or analogy price.

tip: if conservative number is good, go with conservative number/assumptions. no one will care that much about $6b vs $11b market, but if $6b number is very solid, conserviative assumptions and $11b is more speculatively, you'll lose some investors who questions the $11b number and are not satisfied.

analyst estimtes suck == they might have diff ideas of your market or their numbers are off from who you'd target and how you'd charge, or etc (is this true? I'm making this up)


how to estimate tam:
- by analogy
- by competitor
- by survey (meh)
- bottom up
- top down


ALGORITHM:
Think of 5+ frames of reference for analyzing your (b2b) market. Common frames of reference:
demand
- # of prospective purchasers * price per purchase (ideally segmented)
- # of companies * price per department (ideally segmented)
- # of users * price per user
- specific target list (for top heavy markets)

supply
- total sales of all competitors

other
- analyst research on your industry
- by analogy -- name your price, rent to own, etc
- # of sales professionals in competitor industry * average revenue/pro
- survey/turk
- estimate your effect and take 15-25% of that value. (ie. customer gets ROI of 4). for example: you help cmopanies save 10% on HR administration. HR administration is $100b market. You help companies save $6b, and you can probably vcharge $1b-$2b for that.

dont pull numbers out of your ass.

top down: the "chain ratio" approach http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/e8c3f0804a1b4301900dfddd29332b51/Market%2BSizing%2BOverview.pdf?MOD=AJPERES

TAM calculation is like MVP for your business idea.

conservative is better than liberal. if it's $2b-$5b, go with $2b... $5b is is more specualtive and what if you're wrong? $2b is still a great number, easier to jsutify, and gives you a "worst case" of the best case.

why is 1b+ the goal? 1) not much harder to go after 500m than 5b market. 2) 100% of $500m market or 5% of $10b market? later is better because if you can get 5% maybe you cna get 15 or 40 or 99

USUALLY UNSEGMENTED IS DUMB UNLESS ENTIRE MARKET IS SAME (e.g. hs students.. $10/student/year)
