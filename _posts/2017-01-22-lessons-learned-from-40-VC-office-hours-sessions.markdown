Lessons and FAQs from Hosting 50+ (52) VC Office Hours Sessions

for office hours blog post, write about how positive people were.. super uplifting/nice 
also ,no terrible cold emaisl.. got like 50 emails, and all were good. 
diversity stats
lots of apologies about out of data linkedin proifles
summarize office hours
  what kind of questions etc
nps is hard.
hard to make everyone happy... a few ppl liked cafe because it was neutral, others asked for office. a few liked sturcture, a few said they liked unstructured, etc.

1) ideal length of mtg?
2) most common questions?
3) things i learned/ppl i met/etc?
4) useful to add buffer before after so that i can add a few slots if needed

way more demand for SF
got to meet great people (zach holman (but dont mention by name), a few yc co's, engineers at top companies... i was expecting it to mostly be altruitstic, but i think i got as much benefit as other people
maybe i learned stuff from people's questions or discussion, too? 
was the tit for tat part useful?
lots of linkedin profile links were prefaced with "i barely use this" or "this is outdated"

offer way to subscribe to future office hours? maybe subscribe to blog + i'll to to HN/twitter every quarter or so.
